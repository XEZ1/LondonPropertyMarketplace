# London Property Marketplace

## Project Overview:

Welcome to the London Property Marketplace, a sophisticated software application developed to provide users with an innovative and intuitive graphical user interface for exploring temporary rental properties in the vibrant city of London. 

## Project Purpose:

The primary objective of this project was to create a robust and user-friendly GUI application that empowers users to seamlessly navigate and discover available rental properties in London. By utilising real-world data sourced from AirBnB, I aimed to bring a practical and engaging solution to potential renters.

## Key Features:

### Multi-Panel Interface:

I designed the application with a dynamic multi-panel interface to enhance user experience. The main window, which serves as the heart of the application, allows users to explore various data-rich panels, each offering unique insights into the London property market.

### Interactive Navigation:

To facilitate easy navigation through the panels, I implemented "back" and "forward" buttons that enable users to switch between different content sections seamlessly. This feature offers a fluid and intuitive browsing experience, enhancing user engagement.

### Geographical Visualization:

One of the standout features of the application is the interactive map of London's boroughs. This visualisation not only provides users with a geographical context but also visually represents the distribution of available properties in each borough, making the decision-making process more informed.

### Data-Driven Statistics:

The application provides a comprehensive statistics panel, offering users valuable insights into the London property market. From the average number of reviews per property to the most expensive borough based on nightly rates, users can make data-driven decisions when exploring rental options.

### User-Configurable Filtering:

Users have the flexibility to customize their property search by selecting a price range. The intuitive drop-down menus allow users to set both the minimum and maximum price, ensuring that the properties displayed align with their budget and preferences.
